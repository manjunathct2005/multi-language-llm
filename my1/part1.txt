## ðŸ“˜ Part 1: Introduction to Data Science (Detailed)

### What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines techniques from statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific knowledge to extract insights from data. It is a holistic approach that encompasses data gathering, cleaning, exploration, modeling, and communication of results.

It includes tasks like:

* Collecting large datasets from various sources (e.g., sensors, web, databases)
* Cleaning and transforming data to make it usable
* Using statistical methods and machine learning to analyze the data
* Communicating the results using visualizations and reports

### Key Goals of Data Science:

* Uncover hidden patterns in data
* Make predictions and classifications
* Support decision-making
* Automate processes using models

### Data Science Process (Lifecycle)

1. **Problem Understanding**
   Understanding the business/domain problem that needs to be solved.

2. **Data Collection**
   Acquiring data from various sources â€” APIs, databases, files, IoT devices.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   Removing missing values, duplicates, fixing errors, and transforming data formats.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Understanding data through statistics and visualization.

5. **Modeling**
   Applying machine learning models to learn from data and make predictions.

6. **Evaluation**
   Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc., to assess model performance.

7. **Deployment**
   Making the model available for users (e.g., via web APIs or apps).

8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   Checking the model in production for performance degradation.

## ðŸ“˜ Part 2: Python for Data Science (Detailed)

### Why Python?

Python is the most widely used language in the data science ecosystem because of:

* Simple syntax and readability
* Powerful libraries
* Strong community support
* Integration with ML, visualization, APIs, and deployment tools

### Python Fundamentals

#### Variables and Data Types

```python
name = "Manju"
age = 23
height = 5.9
is_student = True
```

#### Data Structures

* **List**: `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`
* **Tuple**: `coords = (10.5, 20.5)`
* **Dictionary**: `student = {"name": "Manju", "age": 21}`
* **Set**: `unique_ids = {1, 2, 3, 4}`

#### Control Flow

```python
# if-else
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

# for loop
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# function
def square(x):
    return x ** 2
```

df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')
df['Sex'] = df['Sex'].map({'male': 0, 'female': 1})
df['Age'] = df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].mean())

X = df[['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age']]
y = df['Survived']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
